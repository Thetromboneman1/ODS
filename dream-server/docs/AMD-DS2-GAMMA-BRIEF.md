# Dream Server Drop Ship (DS2)

Gamma.ai source outline for an AMD-facing DS2 feature deck.

This brief keeps the public product story hardware-neutral while using AMD
hardware as the concrete opportunity. Ryzen AI Max / Strix Halo is the premium
showcase, and the same DS2 flow can extend across AMD mini PCs and
small-form-factor systems from Ryzen AI 450-class devices through Ryzen AI Max
systems.

The DS2 feature is deployed in the Dream Server codebase and tested in pieces,
but it still needs complete end-to-end validation on packaged target hardware
before it should be described as production-ready appliance onboarding.

## Slide 1: The End State

**Secure AMD-powered local AI, chatting in minutes**

Dream Server Drop Ship (DS2) lets an AMD local AI box arrive preinstalled. The
user powers it on, scans a QR code, joins Wi-Fi, and starts using local AI apps
such as Hermes Agent, OpenClaw where enabled, Open WebUI, voice, workflows, and
other Dream Server services.

No monitor. No SSH. No hunting for IP addresses. Scan, connect, chat.

## Slide 2: What Dream Server Is

Dream Server is the local AI app layer for AMD hardware: a local-first AI stack
that bundles inference, chat, agents, voice, workflows, RAG, privacy tools,
dashboards, and extensions onto user-owned hardware.

DS2 adds the missing appliance experience: a preinstalled device can be handed
to a non-technical user and activated from a phone.

- Local inference and services run on the user's hardware.
- AMD acceleration powers the local model backend where supported.
- Users get familiar app surfaces, not just ports and containers.
- Power users still get the dashboard, telemetry, model controls, diagnostics,
  and service management.
- Non-technical users can go straight to chat and agent workflows.

## Slide 3: The Problem

Local AI hardware is powerful, but setup still feels like a developer workflow.

- Many AI-capable devices ship without a permanent monitor or keyboard.
- Users may not know the device IP address, host name, service ports, or admin
  credentials.
- Wi-Fi setup, local discovery, authentication, and chat access are usually
  separate chores.
- A great AMD hardware story can lose momentum if the first-run experience
  starts with SSH, logs, and network debugging.

## Slide 4: The Opportunity

Make local AI hardware feel like opening a useful device, not configuring a
server.

- A vendor, reseller, lab, or friend can preinstall Dream Server.
- The recipient can complete setup from a phone, laptop, tablet, or TV.
- The first experience can be a useful local agent, not a terminal.
- Dream Server keeps the system open for builders while making it approachable
  for everyday users.

## Slide 5: Two AMD Opportunities

**Ryzen AI Max is the showcase. Ryzen AI 450-class systems broaden the path.**

Ryzen AI Max / Strix Halo showcase:

- Premium local AI demo platform.
- Strong story around memory, small form factor, and serious local models.
- Great for creators, labs, developers, and high-end local AI appliances.

Ryzen AI 450-class / mainstream mini-PC category:

- Familiar, broadly deployable system category.
- Familiar small desktop footprint.
- Strong fit for home, office, classroom, and small business local AI.
- Differentiates on private local AI usefulness, not only raw benchmark charts.

## Slide 6: The DS2 Solution

Dream Server connects first-run setup, local discovery, authentication, and app
access.

- Printed setup card with Wi-Fi and setup URL QR codes.
- Optional first-boot access point for machines not already on a network.
- Mobile-friendly setup wizard.
- Host-side Wi-Fi scan and connect actions.
- Local mDNS names such as `dashboard.dream.local`, `chat.dream.local`, and
  `hermes.dream.local`.
- Magic-link invite QR that gives the first user an authenticated local session.
- Agent and chat surfaces behind Dream Server session auth.

## Slide 7: User Journey

1. Power on the preinstalled AMD device.
2. Scan the setup card QR code.
3. Join the setup AP or open the local setup URL.
4. Pick a Wi-Fi network from the first-boot wizard.
5. Scan the invite QR.
6. Land in a local chat or agent experience.
7. Open the dashboard later for models, services, telemetry, and diagnostics.

## Slide 10: Demo Plan

Show the Ryzen AI Max / Strix Halo demo, then show the broader deployment path.

- Start with the Ryzen AI Max / Strix Halo device powered on and no monitor
  attached.
- Scan the setup card from a phone.
- Open the first-boot wizard.
- Join Wi-Fi or confirm existing LAN connectivity.
- Scan the magic-link invite QR.
- Chat with a local agent or chat app from the phone or laptop.
- Open the dashboard to show local services, model status, and controls.
- Close by showing that the same DS2 flow can ship on mainstream AMD mini PCs.

## Slide 11: What Still Needs Validation

The code is present; packaged appliance images need end-to-end validation.

- End-to-end setup on the exact Ryzen AI Max / Strix Halo image.
- End-to-end setup on one or more Ryzen AI 450-class or adjacent AMD-powered
  mini PC images.
- Wi-Fi adapter AP-mode compatibility.
- NetworkManager behavior across target Linux distributions.
- mDNS behavior across common phone, laptop, router, and VPN environments.
- Agent/chat auth handoff through the proxy on packaged images.
- Recovery path when the user changes networks or loses the setup card.

## Slide 12: Feature Rollout Paths

DS2 turns preinstalled AMD systems into ready-to-use local AI appliances.

- Premium Ryzen AI Max / Strix Halo showcase: demonstrate full monitorless setup,
  AMD-accelerated local inference, and local agent/chat surfaces.
- Ryzen AI 450-class mini PC deployment path: use the same QR onboarding flow
  on mainstream small-form-factor systems.
- Retail or reseller handoff: preinstall Dream Server, include the setup card,
  and let the recipient activate the device from a phone.
- Lab, classroom, and office deployment: ship configured local AI boxes without
  requiring each recipient to connect a monitor.
- Marketplace-ready story: once validation is complete, Dream Server can be
  presented as a local AI app stack that makes AMD hardware immediately useful
  to non-technical users.
